# Forward-Returns-Predictive-Model
This repository contains integrated reports and code from a class project which involved analyzing a real financial dataset to build predictive models for forecasting the forward return of a target asset. 

We calculated backward returns, conducted rolling correlation analysis, performed linear regression, utilized K-nearest neighbors (KNN) analysis, applied Ridge and LASSO regression, and implemented Principle Component Regression (PCR). 

Our team developed a custom prediction function in R and submit it to an Online Judge (OJ) for evaluation. This evaluation was based on model accuracy, training and validation data usage, efficient code implementation, and adherence to package limitations specified in the lab materials.

The pdf file contains the project specification, which details both parts of this project (2 and 3, there is no part 1). The html (compiled from jupyter notebooks) and R markdown files contain the R code and and written analysis from part 2. Part 3 is not available to share publicly, but our group used a multivariate linear regression model to pass the Online Judge evaluation, adhering to all restrictions.
