# Forward-Returns-Predictive-Model
This class project involved analyzing a real financial dataset to build predictive models for forecasting the forward return of a target asset. 

We calculated backward returns, conducted rolling correlation analysis, performed linear regression, utilized K-nearest neighbors (KNN) analysis, applied Ridge and LASSO regression, and implemented Principle Component Regression (PCR). 

Our team developed a custom prediction function in R and submit it to an Online Judge (OJ) for evaluation. This evaluation was based on model accuracy, training and validation data usage, efficient code implementation, and adherence to package limitations specified in the lab materials.
